***Kind of Mini Project***

***College Information System***


This portal is helpful for the students who wish to do higher studies. 
They find difficulties in finding better colleges or to know about those colleges.
By using this portal they can easily finds out what they wants to Know.
This portal includes information about campus, administration, placements, courses, and many more. 
Students can go through the reviews and they can ask questions if they want more details.
We developed a chat section so student can easily contact the Alumni/currently pursuing students.
By getting these information students can compare and choose the best college to join.
This project i used Single College info.

***Basically i wanted to do a small social network using this students who wants to join
higher studies they can go through this portal.Let me give you an example If you wants to do
Masters in computer application first thing comes to your mind is Which college,If u choose
'XXX College' you basically check the harward university portal by going through that u get
some basic information,still you need information about the course you directly go to the university
and try get the information they will give you more information but those information they provided how much 
true you don't know by the time you joined the college you get know to what they said its actually not there.
Lets say they said there is a hostel nearby College or say 100% placements or Good Syllabus ,etc instead of going
directly to the college what i did was created portal in that portal students are studying in that college need to 
create account with basic information and also alumni of that particular college and Student who wish to join that particular
college also need to create account in that portal and he/she can ask questions question about the college he will get the genuine answer
from students who are studying there or who are already studied thre and it also has chat facilities.

  “College Campus” is a portal which is helpful for the students who is willing to join the best college. Student can completely know about the colleges by going through this portal and clear their doubts by chatting with the alumni.
	In this portal we have two separate home pages for the alumni and the student, ‘student and the reviewer’. Person should create their account before accessing the portal. It has separate individual page according to their braches. They will take to their own branches as they mentioned their branches while creating account.
	It has a Q&A section their Student/alumni can ask or can answer any question if they have a proper answer. If any answer seems to be improper it can be altered. And we have a special feature of blocking account. If any account reported by four times it will automatically block, and the user no longer be available.
	Although this portal have some minor drawbacks that we can correct in the upcoming updates.
